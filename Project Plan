# Project: AI-Powered Race Pacing & Strategy Coach

This project helps runners optimize their race pacing strategy and identify training risks using simple machine learning models. Designed for high school and college athletes, this tool predicts personalized lap splits based on race history and PR data.

## 🚀 Features (Coming Soon)
- Predict lap splits for the mile based on PR
- Post-race analysis using uploaded GPS/lap split data
- Weekly training load monitor
- Burnout and recovery alerts
- Web dashboard with personalized visualizations

## 📁 Data Format (Sample CSV)
| mile_pr | lap1 | lap2 | lap3 | lap4 |
|---------|------|------|------|------|
| 300     | 75   | 78   | 80   | 82   |
| 290     | 73   | 74   | 76   | 77   |

- `mile_pr`: Total mile personal record in seconds
- `lap1-4`: Lap times (400m split) from previous races
